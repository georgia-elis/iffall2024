        <h1>My Introductory Questions Page</h1>

        <p>1. Georgia Elis, Communication Design, junior</p>

        <p>2. I'm a communication design major and am interested in learning about web design.</p>

        <p>3.I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS</p>

        <p>4. I hope to learn how to better read code and understand the symbols in script.</p>

        <p>5. I think designing for the screens will be different than designing for paper when it comes to thinking about your audience and makign a website that can work in many different scenarios. For screens you have to think about how people interact with your work and in print you don't.</p>

        <p>6. https://www.rcarecords.com/ This website is designed well and easy to navigate while also being visually appealing. The website promotes new music and artists on the first page allowing for people to discover new things, but they can also very easily find what they were looking for using the menu.</p>

        <p>7. https://fpp.net/ This website clearly communicates information about the company and is very easy to navigate. It follows a cohesive story line that goes from an overview of the company to ways to connect with them.</p>

        <p>8. https://www.lacoste.com/us/lacoste-heritage.html I really enjoy this website because of how playful and interactive it is. You can scroll down the main page of the website and find out about the history of the company in an engaging way that also shows off the progress that the company has made.</p>
