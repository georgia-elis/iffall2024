            <p>This is THE best hot crab dip. I'm going to show you how to make what I consider the king of the hot dips, which begins, like most baked dips, with cream cheese, but the key ingredients I use really amplify that crabby flavor. Use the best lump crab you can findâ€”but whether your budget has room for the finest fresh crab or just allows for canned crab, this easy baked dip will still be a hit at your party</p>

            <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
                <p><a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/">Minimalist Baker</a> I like how the website highlights the four most popular recipes and then underneath it there are links to other popular recipes. I also like how there are keys for dietary restrictions and that they are color coded.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/">Love and Lemons</a> I like how large the side margins are on the website because it focuses your attention on the recipes. I also like how they highlight the fan favorite recipes and how they're in two columns.</p>
                <p><a href="https://damndelicious.net/">Damn Delicious</a> I like how all the food photography is taken from above and follows a similar color palette making it all feel unified. I also like that one of the first things on the website is a personal biography about the chef and a button to learn more about her.</p>

            <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.fatchoynyc.com/">Fat Choy</a> I like the hand-drawn illustrations and how some of the typography looks handwritten. When the tab is made smaller than full size some of the words do run together. I also like the mix of real pictures and illustrations.</p>
                <p><a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design</a> I like the bright colors and movement of the typography and shapes when you first open the website. The design feels veyr fun and playful. I do wish the pictures were the same size.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.simplychocolate.com/">Simply Chocolate</a> I like how easy to navigate the website is, and how the seasonal items are highlighted. The website is very user-friendly and you are able to easily search through the website.</p>
