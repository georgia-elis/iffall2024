                <p>Following Manchester United's win in the 2016 FA Cup final, West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2016–17 edition.[120] At the end of the first season at the London Stadium, the team finished 11th, along with having to deal with the departure of star man Dimitri Payet.[121] However, the team suffered a poor start to the following season, taking only two wins in their opening 11 games. Following a 4–1 defeat to Liverpool at home and with the team threatened by relegation, Bilić was sacked on 6 November 2017. He was replaced by former Sunderland boss David Moyes on a contract until the end of the season. The team battled inconsistent form for the rest of the season but managed to avoid relegation and finish 13th. Moyes was not offered a new contract and left the club on the expiration of it on 16 May 2018.</p>

                <p>On 22 May 2018, the club appointed former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini as the new manager on a three-year contract.[123] In his first season in charge, the Hammers finished 10th, once again suffering from inconsistent form. However, after a poor first half to the following season, Pellegrini was sacked in December 2019 with the team only one point above the relegation zone. His last game in charge was a 2–1 home loss to Leicester City.[124] He was replaced by David Moyes, who returned for a second spell in charge a day later.</p>

                <p>On 22 July 2020, the club secured their Premier League status for another season, following a 1–1 draw away to Manchester United.[126] Ahead of the 2020–21 season, West Ham's ownership attracted criticism, including from club captain Mark Noble who publicly criticized the sale of academy graduate Grady Diangana.[127] Despite losing the opening two games of the season, West Ham's form improved and by the end of November, the club sat in fifth place.[128] The club would not drop out of a European spot for the rest of the season and went on to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League group stages after finishing in 6th.[129] Moyes signed a new three-year contract on 12 June 2021.</p>

                <p>West Ham won their first three games of the year 2022, temporarily elevating the club to fourth place in the Premier League.[131] The team beat Sevilla 2–1 on aggregate to reach a first European quarter-final in 41 years,[132] followed by a 4–1 aggregate win over Lyon for a first such semi-final since 1976.[133] Playing the same opposition they met in their 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup semi-final, Eintracht Frankfurt, the Hammers were knocked out of the Europa League, following a 3–1 aggregate loss to the German side.[134] At the end of the 2021–22 Premier League season, West Ham confirmed a second successive season of European football, qualifying for the UEFA Europa Conference League after finishing seventh. The season was also notable for being Mark Noble's final as a West Ham player, with the midfielder retiring from football after 18 years as a first team player at the club, making 550 appearances in all competitions, scoring 62 times.[135] By finishing 7th in the 2021–22 Premier League, West Ham qualified for the 2022–23 Europa Conference League, entering at the play-off stage.</p>

                <p>The 2022–23 campaign was a mixed bag for the Hammers. The club finished 14th in the Premier League, only securing their Premier League status with two games remaining and exiting the League Cup to lower league opposition in a season that saw manager David Moyes come under pressure.[137][138] In January 2023, Mark Noble returned to the club as sporting director.[139] Despite the troubles in West Ham's domestic campaign, they excelled in the Europa Conference League. The club progressed to the final unbeaten, winning 13 games and drawing just once.[140] They went on to win the competition, defeating Fiorentina 2–1 in the final to claim their first major trophy since 1980 and their first European trophy in 58 years.[141] Moyes was not offered a new contract in 2024, having led West Ham to three consecutive European seasons for the first time in their history, reaching at least the quarter-finals of each.[142][143] On May 23, the club named Julen Lopetegui as his replacement.</p>
